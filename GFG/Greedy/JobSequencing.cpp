Job Sequencing Problem 
Medium Accuracy: 48.94% Submissions: 26320 Points: 4
Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated to it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. The task is to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.

Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Job id, Deadline, Profit) associated to that Job.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Jobs = (1,4,20)(2,1,10)(3,1,40)(4,1,30)
Output:
2 60
Explanation:
2 jobs can be done with
maximum profit of 60 (20+40).
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Jobs = (1,2,100)(2,1,19)(3,2,27)
(4,1,25)(5,1,15)
Output:
2 127
Explanation:
2 jobs can be done with
maximum profit of 127 (100+27).

Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function JobScheduling() which takes an Integer N and an array of Jobs(Job id, Deadline, Profit) as input and returns the count of jobs and maximum profit.


Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Deadline <= 100
1 <= Profit <= 500
